# Object literals

This testcase shows you how to use the `DOM` which stands for `Document Object Model`.

Simple Empty Object : 

```js
const empty = {};
```
To fill this object, either you must use the subscript notation `empty[property] = value;`.

The dot notation access the properties and methods in a read-only and/or modification state, 
but it cannot create a new property `empty.property = value`.
